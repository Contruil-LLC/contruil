# Outbound: VP Platform Engineering

**First email — opening paragraph**

---

You're likely running multiple AI providers behind a unified API, and the hardest part is not model quality. It is **control**: consistent policy enforcement, supervised routing decisions, and audit-defensible evidence when AI touches production workflows. Contruil is a supervisory control plane that classifies requests at the API boundary, applies human-gated validation for sensitive actions, and produces an independently verifiable control log. We are offering a **30–60 day, change-managed pilot** that runs alongside your existing stack, with no model replacement and no lock-in.

**Why VP Platform Engineering first**

- Own the integration surface
- Can validate feasibility fast
- Can pull in Security and Risk as approvers once the control-plane story is concrete
